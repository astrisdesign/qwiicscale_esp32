# qwiicscale
 A CircuitPython library for nau7802 using the I2C interface, meant for the ESP32-S2 microcontroller. This is a port of [SparkFun's Qwiic Scale Arduino library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_Scale_NAU7802_Arduino_Library).
 This library has not been thoroughly tested, but all methods of the NAU7802 class work and the examples should execute successfully with required dependencies.
